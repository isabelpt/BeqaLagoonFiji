        <p>Off the Sourthern shore of Fiji’s main island, Viti Levu, lies the Beqa Lagoon. Beqa Lagoon is a tourist hotspot, especially for shark diving. In 2010, 7.9 million dollars in revenue was generated by the two shark diving tourism operators in the area (CITE). The Shark Corridor is a 30km stretch of protected water within the lagoon where shark fishing is prohibited (TO CITE: coastal community benefits). Within the Shark Corridor, the main diving operator, Beqa Adventure Divers (BAD), runs 2 dives a day, 5 days a week in the Shark Reef Marine Reserve (SRMR), that they established as Fiji’s first National Marine Park in 2014. BAD partners with the nearby village of Galoa to manage the Marine Park and promote a blue economy.

        <h2>Species Protected</h2>
        <p>Bull sharks, grey reef sharks, whitetip and blacktip reef sharks, tawny nurse sharks, sicklefin lemon sharks, silvertip sharks, and tiger sharks.
    </p>
        <h2>Qoliqoli Rights</h2>
        <p>The Quliqoli system grants fishing rights to Fijian coastal communities for subsistence fishing within their customary fishing rights areas. Village chiefs must approve any commercial fishing within their Qoliqoli area before it can be endorsed by the government. The village of Galoa sold their Qoliqoli rights to their part of the Beqa Lagoon to Beqa Adventure divers, to create the no-take zone Shark Ree Marine Reserve (TO CITE: Coastal Community Benefits).</p>
        <h2>Levy Payments</h2>
        <p>A $10.80 USD entrance fee is collected from anyone who enters the Shark Reef Marine Reserve, which is paid to the villages who sold their Qoliqoli rights. Roughly $100,000 is distributed to local communities each year, and the money goes towards various projects including construction, education, infastructure development, and flood mitigation (TO CITE: Coastal Community Benefits).</p>
        <h2>Community Participation</h2>
        <p>Beqa Adventure Divers are in charge of enforcing the Marine Protected Area. In partnership with the Fiji Department of Fisheries, they train their staff and local fishermen to become fish wardens, representatives of the Dept. who report and document illegal fishing activities to prompt law enforcement agencies to investigate. In addition, the majority of Beqa Adventure Divers employees are locals as they train one individual from Galoa each year to become a divemaster (TO CITE: Coastal Community Benefits).</p>
