    <h1>Solutions &amp; Policies</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Effectiveness of the Marine Protected Area</h2>  
      <div class="text">
          <h4>Varying levels of enforcement</h4>
          <p>There are four total Marine Protected Areas in the Beqa Lagoon; the Shark Reef Marine Reserve and Kauvala Tabu are managed by tourism operators, while the Cavity and Navata-i-Lulu Marine Protects areas are managed by local communities. The effectiveness of enforcement at the latter two sites is uncertain as the areas are larger and more distant from the communities in charge.<sup><a href="#fn1b" id="ref1b">1</a></sup> A 2019 reef survey of the Beqa Lagoon concluded that <ul><li>"Coral cover and diversity did not seem to be affected by marine protection over fished reefs."</li><li>"Fish and invertebrate levels were low at all sites except the [Shark Reef Marine Reserve]."</li><li>"The other three MPA survey sites were no better, or in one, case worse, than fished sites."</li></ul>These findings indicate that most of the Marine Protected Areas lack the resources for proper management and enforcement.</p><br>
          <h4>Size and scale matters</h4>
          <p>The size of the Marine Protected Areas is another important factor. Since sharks are highly migratory, the extent to which the Shark Reef Marine Reserve can protect them is limited. Nationwide shark conservation policies are needed to prevent declining shark populations in the marine reserve. This is especially complicated by the presence of a competing dive operator just outside the marine reserve who does not share the same philosophy of shark conservation and comunity benefit.<sup><a href="#fn2b" id="ref2b">2</a></sup></p>
      </div>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Co-Management and Collaboration</h2>
      <div class="text">
          <h4>Successes</h4>
          <p>The inclusion of stake- and rightsholders in the ecosystem conservation and research in the Beqa Lagoon aligns with the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, especially 8: decent work and economic growth, 10: reduced inequalities, 11: sustainable cities and communities, 13: climate action, 14: life below water, and 17: partnerships for the goals. Alignment with the SDGs provides freedom to marginalized populations, in this case Fijians from coastal communities most effected by climate change, by providing them with the resources to supply themselves with protection from environmental harm.</p>
          <p>Both tourism operators and locals are motivated to conserve the marine ecosystem for the various ecosystem services it provides. By working together, they acquire the resources to more effectively protect it. The 2012-2016 Great Fiji Shark Count was a collaboration between researchers and dive tourism operators where guests and operators recorded the shark counts and other details at 592 dive sites across 24 areas around Fiji.<sup><a href="#fn3b" id="ref3b">3</a></sup> While participatory science programs often lack a degree of precision, they fill important gaps in data availability and help further understanding of the changing role of sharks in the marine ecosystem. In addition, by including stakeholders in the research process, they acquire a deeper understanding of how to protect the ecosystem.</p>
          <h4>Challenges</h4>
          <p>Even though the villages sold their Qoliqoli fishing rights to Beqa Adventure Divers, there is no legal requirement for the dive operator to collect the levy from the divers who enter the Shark Reef Marine Reserve and allocate it equitably to the villages.<sup><a href="#fn2b" id="ref2b">2</a></sup> To date, there have been no known issues with the levy allocation, creating a narrow power disconnect where the tourism operator has the resources, understanding, and incentives to protect the marine ecosytem and the coastal communities. In addition, through the levy payments and employment opportunities they provide the coastal communities with the resources and understanding to protect their land and livelihoods. However, without a legal requirement for the dive company to pay the villages, this current system could fall apart if the company switched ownsership or if values changed.</p><br>
          <p>Another important area of growth is the inclusion of women from the local villages. Throughout Fijian coastal communities, "women are the major contributors of subsistence food production. The major fishing grounds for women are typically areas closer to shore compared to men who fish mostly from boats in deeper waters and do underwater diving".<sup><a href="#fn4b" id="ref4b">4</a></sup> In addition, women in Galoa play an important role in alerting fish wardens of any illegal fishing that they witness in the Marine Protected Areas.<sup><a href="#fn5b" id="ref5b">5</a></sup> Despite their contributions, women do not recieve much recognition and are generally not included in decision making. Progress in this area includes training women as fish wardens, including their perspectives as stakeholders in policy and research, and giving them the understanding and resources to protect their environment through projects such as mangrove reforestation.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Summary and Future Steps</h2>
      <div class="text">
          <h4>Strengthening nationwide and international policies</h4>
          <p>Since many shark species, especially bull sharks which are the most commonly found species in the Beqa Lagoon, are highly migratory, shark conservation is a global problem that requires a global solution. A 2015 study found that two species of sharks protected under CITES Appendix II, the scalloped hammerhead and oceanic whitetip shark, were found to be sold in a Fijian fish market.<sup><a href="#fn4b" id="ref4b">4</a></sup> Appendix II allows commercial trade only with proper permits because a species is threatened with extinction unless trade is controlled. While regulations exist, they almost always lack proper enforcement due to a lack of resources. The private-public partnership of the Shark Reef Marine Reserve reduces the burden on the Fiji Ministry of Fisheries, but Beqa Adventure Divers only monitors the reef during the daytime when the dive trips are running, leaving many hours in the day for poaching to potentially occur. A potential solution is to hire more fish wardens from the local villages, who can monitor the no-take zone at other times of the day, especially at night.</p>
          <h4>Stronger enforcement of Marine Protected Areas</h4>
          <p><i>“In this day and age, with all the stresses imposed on coral reefs and other marine environments, an area is not magically or instantaneously ‘protected’ via an MPA designation process – protection must be fought for – and it may never be attained”.<sup><a href="#fn6b" id="ref6b">6</a></sup></i></p>
          <p>Marine Protected Areas are almost always more difficult to enforce than they are to create. Proper enforcement requires narrow power disconnect and community buy-in. Regulations should be strict enough to conserve the ecosystem, but not so strict that they harm the communities that rely on provisioning ecosystem services. Alternative income sources such as tourism in the case of the Shark Reef Marine Reserve should be prirotized to further develop the blue economy; however, while tourism has helped to diversity the blue economy, further diversification should occur to avoid a dependency on tourism.</p>
          <h4>Strengthening community involvement</h4>
          <p>Continued success in protecting the Beqa Lagoon requires strengthening the involvement of all stakeholders in the implementation of new conservation methods, a commitment to understanding their needs and attitudes, the consideration of traditional systems of resource management such as the Qoliqoli system, combining customary and common law, and ensuring that new stable income streams are set up when fishing areas are closed. Without these considerations, failures can arise from a lack of equity or compensation, or from corruption and increased competition.
          </p>
          <h4>Continue research efforts</h4>
          <p>While many research studies have been conducted in the Beqa Lagoon, more research is needed to understand how the shark provisioning tourism operators effect the marine ecosystem. In addition, the effects of climate change on the ecosystem should be monitored. This research is essential to understand how to most effectively conserve the Beqa Lagoon. While the global nature of shark populations and climate change mean there are many other factors that determine the health of the lagoon, by researching the health of the lagoon and implementing effective conservation practices such as mangrove reforestation and less-harmful tourism practices, the amount of time in which the local communities have access to the ecosystem services will be prolonged.</p>
          <h4>Opportunities to scale?</h4>
          <p>While to date the private-public management system of the Shark Reef Marine Reserve has supported local communities, furthered scientific research, and has slightly improved the health of the marine ecosystem, it should not be treated as a panacea.</p>
          <p><b>Within the Beqa Lagoon: </b></p>
          <p>Scaling within the Beqa Lagoon is challenging because the introduction of more dive tourism operators leads to increased competition and exploitation, especially if they do not have the same incentives of conservation or community collaboration. In addition, expanding the protected area requires additional monitoring and enforcement, and conflict may arise from the distribution of the levy payments to many villages.</p>
          <p><b>Elsewhere:</b></p>
          <p>The core pillars of community collaboration, consideration of customary law, scientific research, and overall conservation should be applied to other ecoregions, but the specific approach should consider the nuances of the region and its culture. For example, the Qoliqoli system determines how the Marine Protected Areas are enforced in Fiji and other countries will have unique legal frameworks and cultural values to navigate and support.</p>
