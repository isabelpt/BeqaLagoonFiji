    <h2 class="subtitle">Effectiveness of the Marine Protected Area</h2>  
      <div class="text">
          <h4>Successes</h4>
          <h4>Challenges</h4>
          <p>There are four total Marine Protected Areas in the Beqa Lagoon; the Shark Reef Marine Reserve and Kauvala Tabu are managed by tourism operators, while the Cavity and Navata-i-Lulu Marine Protects areas are managed by local communities. The effectiveness of enforcement at the latter two sites is uncertain as the areas are larger and more distant from the communities in charge (TO CITE: 2019 Reef Surveys). A 2019 reef survey of the Beqa Lagoon concluded that <ul><li>"Coral cover and diversity did not seem to be affected by marine protection over fished reefs."</li><li>"Fish and invertebrate levels were low at all sites except the [Shark Reef Marine Reserve]."</li><li>"The other three MPA survey sites were no better, or in one, case worse, than fished sites."</li></ul>These findings indicate that most of the Marine Protected Areas lack the resources for proper management and enforcement.</p>
            <p>The size of the Marine Protected Areas are another important factor. Since sharks are highly migratory, the extent to which the Shark Reef Marine Reserve can protect them is limited. Nationwide shark conservation policies are needed to prevent declining shark populations in the marine reserve. This is especially complicated by the presence of a competing dive operator just outside the marine reserve who does not share the same philosophy of shark conservation and comunity benedit (TO CITE: Coastal Community pg. 4).</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Co-Management Strategies (rename)</h2>
      <div class="text">
          <h4>Successes</h4>
          <p>The inclusion of stake- and rightsholders in the ecosystem conservation and research in the Beqa Lagoon aligns with the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, especially 8: decent work and economic growth, 10: reduced inequalities, 11: sustainable cities and communities, 13: climate action, 14: life below water, and 17: partnerships for the goals.</p>
          <p>Both tourism operators and locals are motivated to conserve the marine ecosystem for the various ecosystem services it provides. By working together, they acquire the resources to more effectively protect it. [Participatory Science- Great Fiji Shark Count- collaboration, trust, etc.]</p>
          <h4>Challenges</h4>
          <p>Even though the villages sold their Qoliqoli fishing rights to Beqa Adventure Divers, there is no legal requirement for the dive operator to collect the levy from the divers who enter the Shark Reef Marine Reserve and allocate it equitably to the villages (TO CITE: coastal community pg. 4). To date, there have been no known issues with the levy allocation, creating a narrow power disconnect where the tourism operator has the resources, understanding, and incentives to protect the marine ecosytem and the coastal communities. In addition, through the levy payments and employment opportunities they provide the coastal communities with the resources and understanding to protect their land and livelihoods. However, without a legal requirement for the dive company to pay the villages, this current system could fall apart if the company switched ownsership or if values changed.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Summary and Future Steps</h2>
      <div class="text">
          <h4>Strengthening policies</h4>
          <p>Since many shark species, especially bull sharks which are the most commonly found species in the Beqa Lagoon, are highly migratory, shark conservation is a global problem that requires a global solution. A 2015 study found that two species of sharks protected under CITES Appendix II, the scalloped hammerhead and oceanic whitetip shark, were found to be sold in a Fijian fish market (TO CITE: char. of shark fisheries). Appendix II allows commercial trade only with proper permits because a species is threatened with extinction unless trade is controlled. While regulations exist, they almost always lack proper enforcement due to a lack of resources. The private-public partnership of the Shark Reef Marine Reserve reduces the burden on the Fiji Ministry of Fisheries, but Beqa Adventure Divers only monitors the reef during the daytime when the dive trips are running, leaving many hours in the day for poaching to potentially occur. A potential solution is to hire more fish wardens from the local villages, who can monitor the no-take zone at other times of the day, especially at night.</p>
          <p>Fijians want these regulations: â€œAll interviewees, without exception, would welcome decisions by the Fijian government to protect sharks nationwide (TO CITE: Ecological knowledge pg. 94)</p>
          <p>Enforcement of MPAs is often difficult, and requires narrow power disconnects- strict regulations are difficult to enforce and harm local communities that rely on provisioning ecosystem services (TO CITE: marine tourism project pg. 30)</p>
          <h4>Strengthening co-management strategies</h4>
          <p>For success, include stakeholders in implementation, and understand their needs and attitudes, consider traditional systems of resource management; combine customary and modern management; if closing fishing areas also need to create new income streams</p>
          <p>Sources of failure: equity, compensation, corruption, competition</p>
          <h4>Diversify the blue economy</h4>
          <h4>Continue research efforts</h4>
          <h4>Opportunities to scale?</h4>
          <p>Fiji's EEZ is 70% larger than its landmass.</p>
